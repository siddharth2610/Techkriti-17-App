        public static final String data11 = "Q) Can I participate in multiple events?<br>  <br>A) Yes, you can.  <br><br>Q) What is qualification time?  <br><br>A) To participate in any of the main events, you must be able to solve that puzzle in time less than the corresponding qualification time.  <br><br>Q) Do I need to get the cubes?  <br><br>A) As per the regulations of WCA you may or may not bring your own cubes. You may choose to borrow from any other participants or the organizers. Although we will be providing good quality lubricated cubes, participants are suggested to use their own cubes as performance with a familiar cube is always likely to be better.  <br><br>Q) How is the solve time calculated?  <br><br>A) The solving time is calculated using the stackmat timers. This is a stackmat timer.  <br><br>Q) Would you consider the average solve time or the best time?  <br><br>A) In the events having multiple solves for a single event, we would take the average. For other events (blindfolded, multiple blindfolded, fewest moves), the best solve time is considered. For details about how the averages are calculated for each events, check the regulations tab.  <br><br>Q) What if my cube breaks open during a solve?  <br><br>A) The participant may stop or continue with the solve. Details on how to continue with the solve are given on the WCA website under Article 5:Puzzle Defects.  <br><br>Q) What if my cube falls during a solve?  <br><br>A) You must pick up the cube and start solving from the point where you left. In case of one-handed cubing, you should pick it up with the same hand with which you were solving it.  <br><br>Q) What happens when my cube touches any body part other than my hands?  <br><br>A) You are disqualified. In case of one-handed cubing, only the solving hand should touch the cube and any contact from the other hand may also lead to disqualification.  <br><br>Q) Does memorisation time count in Blindfolded solves?  <br><br>A) Yes.  <br><br>Q) Should I remove the Blindfold before or after stopping the timer?  <br><br>A) Either way is correct. It is just a matter of personal choice. Detailed regulations on Blindfolded cubing are available on the WCA website under Article B.  <br><br>Q) What happens once I take my Blindfold off?  <br><br>A) You cannot make any more moves. If the cube is unsolved when you take it off, the solve will be considered as DNF(Did not finish).";

The roll rate has to be constant and the longitudinal axis of the plane has to go straight. This requires constantly changing rudder and elevator control inputs throughout the roll.  <br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(7)\"><br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(8)\"><br><br>-> <b><u>Inside Loop:</u></b> A vertical circle entered from straight and erect level flight. A positive pitching movement is used at all points in the loop to draw the circle, so that the aeroplane canopy is pointing inwards.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(9)\"><br>  <br><br>-> <b><u>Inverted Loop:</u></b> Vertical loop in which plane remains inverted at start and end of the loop.  <br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(10)\"><br><br>-> <b><u>Split-S:</u></b> The figure starts with a half roll to inverted followed by the second half of a loop downward. This is another manoeuver to reverse direction. This does not preserve speed and altitude. In this case it trades altitude for speed. (K=10)<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(11)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>Hammerhead:</u></b> 1/4 loop (pull or push) to vertical, as momentum/airspeed decreases, rudder is applied and the aircraft rotates around its yaw axis, the nose falls through the horizon and points towards the ground, a momentary pause is made to draw the vertical down line, and 1/4 loop to level flight. This figure is sometimes called a stall turn which is a misnomer because the aircraft never actually stalls.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(12)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>Square loop:</u></b> This is a variation of the basic loop. The two vertical lines and the horizontal line on top have to be of the same length. The exit line at the bottom has to be at least as long as the other three sides. The quarter loops that connect the four sides have to have the same radius at each corner.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(13)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>Humpty-Bump:</u></b> This starts with a quarter loop followed by a half roll to a vertical climb. A half loop then results in a vertical down-line. The manoeuvre completes with another quarter loop to horizontal flight.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(14)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>4 Point Roll:</u></b> The four-point roll (hesitation roll) is a horizontal roll with a brief hesitation at 90, 180 and 270 degrees. You should be able to do a roll without any altitude loss or heading deviation.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(15)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>Cuban Eight:</u></b> Two Half Cuban Eights can be combined to form a Cuban Eight or Lay-down Eight. The two looping parts have to be flown at the same altitude with the same radius. The exit has to be at the same altitude as the entrance to the figure.<br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(16)\"><br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(17)\">  <br><br>-> <b><u>Flat Spin:</u></b> During spin entry, the plane has to show a stall break, followed by the auto-rotation. The rotation has to stop exactly after the specified number of turns. Once the rotation has stopped, a vertical downline has to be established. <br><img src=\"./events_files/saved_resource(18)\">   <br><br><b><u>SPOT LANDING:</u></b> (Maximum Points 50, 30, 20)    <br><br>->After completing the manoeuvers proceed for spot landing. The landing zone will be marked on the airstrip. The plane is to touch down precisely in the arena. The better the touchdown greater the marks obtained.<br>->In case of crash landing, no points will be given for landing. Damage to the propeller will not be consider as crash landing.  <br><br><b><u>Arena point distribution:</u></b> <br>-> Innermost circular region (2m in diameter) will have 50 points. <br>-> Concentric circular region (3m in diameter) will have 30 points. <br>-> Outermost circular region (5m in diameter) will have 20 points.";
