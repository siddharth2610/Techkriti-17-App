Here comes <b>Bridge Designing Challenge</b> which gives you a great opportunity to prove your mettle as an innovative engineer and mark your talent nationwide by building your own model of bridge.  Initially bridges made by humans were probably spans of wooden logs or planks and eventually stones,using a simple support and crossbeam arrangement to provide a free passage over obstacles, But technology and engineering changed techniques and led to more complicated structure and stronger bridges. So before proceeding with the construction of such complex and stronger bridges it is necessary that we need to model it and test its performance in the lab.   So, now its your time to build your bridge model with creativity, technique and your engineering brains using noodles! So do come and be a part of this extraordinary event which surely gives you amazing experience.";

Only one member from the team is supposed to explain their machine before the demonstration. <br>7. Each team will have a 15 minute reset time if they opt for more than one run. <br>8. Only one team member is allowed to interact with the machine once the evaluation has begun. This includes resetting the machine during the run. This means that only one person will be allowed inside the arena. However, if the team goes for another run, the restriction of one person inside the arena is uplifted until the machine is ready for the other run. <br>9. Every team must have a leader.

However, for the sole purpose of electrical connection wires can be outside the boundaries of the arena.<br>11. Each step in the machine should be considered as transfer of energy from one action to another. Identical transfers of energy in succession should be considered one step. For e.g., a set of dominos falling into each other should be considered one step. While technically each single domino falling is a step, stating one hundred steps for hundred dominos is repetitive and against the spirit of Rube Goldberg. <br>12. The task should be completed in not more than 4 minutes. Marks will be deducted if time limit exceeds. <br>13. No hazardous materials or explosives may be used on or within the machine.

No live animals are allowed in the machine. <br>15. Every team will be given maximum three runs for the completion of the task so that if, in case, a team fails to complete the task in their first run, they can go for second run. In the first two runs, the best amongst the two scores will be considered as final. However,if a team uses the third turn only the score in this run would be considered. The previous two turns will be ignored. <br>16. For every human intervention, points will be deducted. 17. Any destructive action against another machine is grounds for disqualification. <br>18. Programmable Logic Controllers or any other electronic controller/devices may be used on the machines. The use of these devices must be in line with a step. Using these devices as a fail-safe for the machine is illegal and grounds for disqualification. <br>19. Let's say a ball is supposed to fall onto a switch and turn on a motor which is run by the controller. o If the ball misses the switch, but the controller still starts the motor, the controller is not transferring energy from one step to the next step. It is acting as fail safe so the machine can finish its task and is not in line with definition of a step. o If the ball hits the switch and the controller starts the motor as it should, the device is merely transferring the energy from one step to another, so this is line with the definition of a step. <br>20. If a controller/electronic device is used, each instance of its operation should be clearly stated in the step-by-step description submitted along with the written description. <br>21. Each instance should be considered one step, but please supply detailed information of how the step is being accomplished.<br>22.
